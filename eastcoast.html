        <h2>What you see on the East Coast</h2>
        <h3>Northeastern</h3>
        <p> The Northeastern coast is famous for its various mountains and extensive forests. Cities like Boston, Philadelphia, and Manhattan all have a rich history behind them. These cities date back to the origins of our country and a variety of war sites can be visited. Travel to New York City and journey up or admire the architecture of the Empire State building. Take a hike with family or friends up the White Mountains, some of the largest mountains in the country. Swim in the vast and beautiful beaches of Cape Cod or Rhode Island.  
        </p>
        <h3>Southeastern</h3>
        <p> The Southeastern coast is a rustic environment with beaches that leave you captivated. This region is surprisingly a neglected area when people plan vacations. Aside from the famous theme parks of Disney, many people are unsure of the other possible activities. Swimming with manatees along the Florida Gulf coast is a very enjoyable experience for those who have had their fair share of Disney trips. Manatees are a curious and friendly creature that have no issue swimming right up to your boat for a close interaction. Finally, the Everglades National Park is one of the most scenic places to visit in the area. Catch a glimpse of all your favorite animals for an experience to never regret. </p>
