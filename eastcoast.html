        <h2>What you see in the East Coast</h2>
        <p> The Northeastern coast is famous for its various mountains and extensive forests. Cities like Boston,
            Philadelphia, and Manhattan all have a rich history behind them. These cities date back to the origins
            of our country and a variety of war sites can be visited. Travel to New York City and journey up or
            admire the architecture of the Empire State building. Take a hike with family or friends up the White
            Mountains, some of the largest mountains in the country.  
        </p>
        <p> The Southeastern coast is a rustic environment with beaches that leave you captivated. </p>
