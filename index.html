                    <h2>West Coast</h2>
                    <p>The Western coast may not have the history of the Eastern coastal towns, but it has beauty that is worthy of any bucket list. Go see the Northern vibrant green mountains run right into the blue sea, with beautiful grey pebble beaches separating the collision. Bask in the sun of California beaches, after a day of shopping in San Fransisco or Los Angeles and eating the finest food the west has to offer.</p>

                    <h2>East Coast</h2>
                    <p>From the extensive forests and metropolitan areas of the Northeastern coast, to the rustic Carolinas, to the lively culture of Florida, the Eastern coast is full of history and beauty. The history from the original thirteen colonies is vast spanning several American War sites and the seeds of immigration of the United States. Tour the culture of cities like Boston, Philadelphia, Manhattan, and see the Statue of Liberty.  Then rest your toes is some of the most peaceful and entertaining beaches in the world.</p>
