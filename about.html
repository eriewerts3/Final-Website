            <h2>Callie Roth: Artist & CSS</h2>
                    <p>Main contributer to the stylesheets. I arranged the color schemes and chose the photos used throughout the website. I executed the layouts of each page, however the design of the layouts was a collaborative effort made by all team members.</p>

            <h2>Connor Magee: HTML & Researcher & Assignment Submission Expert</h2>
                    <p>Main contributer to the Eastcoast and Westcoast pages. I was responsible for doing research on the two regions and also helped during the debugging stages. Everything else was a team effort and I am grateful to my teams for being available consistently and being open to all team members ideas.</p>

			<h2>Edward Riewerts: Organizer & HTML </h2>
                    <p>Main contributer to the index, reference, and about pages.  Though I can't emphasize how much a team effort it was.  Connor for example coded the footer for these pages. The whole team helped debug and edit all the code. I also organized the meetings, task schedules, and meeting notes.  I also wrote the Wire Frame and the Site Map, though agian, that was a team effort over a virtual meeting.</p>
